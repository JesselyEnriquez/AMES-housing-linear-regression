    "In the United States highs schoolers typically take a standardized tests, SAT or ACT, to determine if they are college ready. It is typically required by universities and colleges to determine admission. There are many debates as to the credibility of these tests and their measure of \"readiness\" from grade point average to extra curriculars. In this notebook it is important to note that the maximum ACT score is 36. Additionally that note note different area of the US have different preferences. \n",
